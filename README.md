# What is it?

It is my study project of VR View for the Web 

## Install
    npm install
    
## Start
Start development server on http://localhost:8080<br>
Browser will auto reload when js, scss, html changed.

    gulp

## Build
```
    gulp build
```
## Note
When use vrview.js, it will get image from storage.googleapis.com by defailt. I don't know how to change it to get image from local.
So, I uploaded the testing images to https://storage.googleapis.com/designquest-360/stereo-test.jpg, then it works.
